# ⚙️ MegaNodes API — Fundamentals

This page provides a **basic understanding** of how the MegaNodes API works.

Once you have taken a glance at our API, let's move forward to the next step right now.

---

## 🧰 What You Need to Start

Before you begin, we assume you already have:

- A basic understanding of **RESTful APIs**
- Familiarity with **Node.js**, **PHP**, or other backend programming languages

You will need an **API_TOKEN** issued by our administrators.  
This token acts as your **unique identity** to bypass our security checks.

> ⚠️ Please keep your token string confidential.  
> Exposing your API token may lead to unauthorized access, and MegaNodes is **not responsible** for misuse caused by token exposure.

### 🔑 Example API Token

ed45553e-1702-4342-a70d-09bf7ff7f568

---

### 🧾 Account & Token Management

You will receive one or more **back office accounts** based on your currency requirements.  
Each account corresponds to a **single currency** — if you need support for multiple currencies, you’ll need separate accounts for each.

You can find your **API_TOKEN** inside your **back office account** under settings.

- 🔗 **Back Office URL:** [https://sc4-admin-tr1.dreamgates.net/](https://sc4-admin-tr1.dreamgates.net/)

If you do not yet have your credentials, please **contact us** to obtain your accounts.

---

## 📬 HTTP Headers

All HTTP requests sent to the MegaNodes API must include the following headers:

| Name | Value | Example |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Authorization** | Bearer `{API_TOKEN}` | `Authorization: Bearer ed45553e-1702-4342-a70d-09bf7ff7f568` |
| **Accept** | `application/json` | `Accept: application/json` |
| **Content-Type** | `application/json` | `Content-Type: application/json` |

These headers ensure authenticated, properly formatted communication with the MegaNodes servers.

---

## 🧱 System Security

To maintain stability and prevent abuse:

- Simultaneous calls from the same **agent** are limited to **50 concurrent requests**.  
- If this limit is exceeded, the API returns the error:

SERVER_IS_BUSY (1018)


When this occurs, **wait for the current requests to complete** before retrying.

---

## 🌐 IP Restriction

The MegaNodes API can **only** be accessed from IP addresses specified in your **Back Office → Settings** page.

- Add multiple IPs by separating them with a **space** or **newline**  
  Example:
1.1.1.1
2.2.2.2


If you prefer not to restrict access by IP, leave the **Allowed IP** field blank.

---

## 🔄 Basic Workflow

### 👤 1. Creating Users
Every player must first be created in the MegaNodes system.  
Even if you already have a player table in your own database, our API synchronizes user data to ensure accurate identification.

Once a user is created, the system assigns a unique integer called **`user_code`**, which serves as the player’s permanent ID within MegaNodes.

---

### 🎮 2. Game Launch
When a player opens a game:
1. Your system calls the **MegaNodes API** to obtain a **one-time-use game URL**.  
2. Your casino then **redirects the player** to that URL.  
3. The player can place bets, win, or lose — all recorded in real time via our API.

---

### 💸 3. Bet and Win/Lose Processing
When the player places a bet:
- The MegaNodes API generates results based on your casino’s **RTP settings**.
- It automatically records the **transaction history**.
- Player balances are updated instantly.

If a transaction fails (e.g., network interruption or timeout), **all funds are automatically refunded** to ensure no player losses occur due to system errors.

---

## 🧩 Agent Subsystems

- An **Agent** represents a **single casino website operator**.  
- An **Operator** manages one or more agents under their control.  

Operators can:
- Create and manage **sub-agents**
- Oversee transactions and balances
- Manage their entire agent tree via the **[Agent → Agents Treeview]** page in the back office

If you are a **broker** reselling the API, you can also create and manage multiple **Operators** under your structure.

---

## 💰 Balance System

Each **agent** is assigned a **digital wallet** containing **points** — the system’s internal currency used for all casino operations.

- Agents require sufficient points to operate their casino.
- Points can be **transferred from parent operators** to their sub-agents.
- This hierarchical flow of points ensures smooth, traceable operations.

Without enough points, an agent cannot launch games or process bets.

## 🔄 Integration Models

MegaNodes API supports **two integration models**:

1. **Seamless Mode**  
 The player’s balance is managed directly through your platform.  
 MegaNodes only requests balance updates from your wallet API.

2. **Money Transfer Mode**  
 The player’s balance is managed inside the MegaNodes system.  
 Funds are transferred between your platform and MegaNodes via API calls.

---

By following these fundamentals — token-based authentication, proper header usage, IP whitelisting, and structured agent management — you can integrate with confidence and efficiency.
