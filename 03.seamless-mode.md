# Seamless Mode

This page outlines the workflow for **Seamless Integration** in MegaNodes API.

---

## 🧩 Basic Insights

The **MegaNodes API** provides seamless integration, giving you full control over your users' balances.  

This mode keeps your users' balances completely **isolated from our servers**, protecting you from any potential malicious activity by third-party API providers.

By using Seamless Mode, you can integrate **multiple APIs** within your casino platform.  
This enables you to manage user balances and transactions across different providers without conflicts, ensuring smooth operation and maximum flexibility.

## ⚙️ How It Works

In Seamless Mode, our API interacts directly with your backend:

1. **You call our main API endpoint**, such as: [POST /v4/user/create] to create a new user in our system.

2. **Our API sends a Callback Request** to your backend’s Callback URL to obtain essential data, such as:
- Player’s current balance  
- User permissions  
- Any other required information  

> **Note:** Our API does not store player data. It depends on your backend to return the data via Callback Requests.

3. **Callback Token Verification**  
Every Callback Request from our API includes a header: Callback-Token: YOUR_TOKEN_STRING. This token is generated by our system and can be found in the **[Settings]** section of your Back Office.

4. **You must respond** to the Callback Request with the required data structure.  
Before doing so:
- Validate the `Callback-Token` header value.
- Verify all incoming request data carefully.
- Return a well-formatted JSON response according to our defined schema.

5. **API Response Handling**  
After receiving your response, our API will:
- Parse the data from your JSON response.
- Send a **success** or **error** message based on the validity of your response.
